## Agenda

- Status update on BLOOM photos / general content check-in
- Review [notes from DEPLOY/24 debrief](https://github.com/compsigh/deploy/blob/main/DEPLOY24%20Debrief%20and%20Notes%20for%20DEPLOY25.md)
- BLOOM debrief: what didn't go well, notes for DEPLOY/25, what went well

## Notes

### (Before getting into BLOOM stuff) content focus

- Recap post of last couple compsigh nights, recap post of BLOOM
- Get to know leadership reel
  - Kiana will schedule these with the team

### Judges, sponsors, prizes

- Like DEPLOY/24, need to (reach out to judges) / (work on the trophy) a lot sooner. Ended up phenomenal but we can't chance something like that. In general most things for hackathons should be ready a month before.
- Need much better/more frequent communication with sponsors
- We did alright with prizes, a decent middle ground for something not super emphasized in marketing

### Scoring

- 1st, 2nd, 3rd, People's Choice model continues to work well
- Emphasizing it's ok if projects aren't complete worked really well. Super proud of how we lowered the barrier and we had *three* solo projects from people confident enough to present
- Surprisingly, for next time we could use *more* emphasis on presentation. Mainly bcs we gave teams 7 mins + 2 mins questions, and for future events we probably don't want to do that. So emphasizing making use of not a lot of time would be beneficial.
- Really happy with the vibe check scoring, totally opened the floor to creative projects that weren't sweaty but still sick, satirical projects, etc.
  - Relative scoring (projects all on a "matrix" so they can be assessed relative to each other) was good
  - Platform / UX around scoring still needs work — Tally *worked*, but would be nice to not have to prepopulate form fields
- No AI rule: net good

### Food, merch, trailer

- Food was great
- Merch was good but we spent too much for what we ended up getting
- We were alright with not having a trailer. Def a nice-to-have, not essential

### Promo, outreach, marketing

- BLOOM's messaging was clear, but we opened the scope too broadly, so no one really felt the event was *for them* ("if we're open to anyone, we're not *for* anyone" -Jet)
  - Going into non-CS classes did not yield results, but hard to tell given the bad timing in general
  - For DEPLOY/25 we should go all in on CS. We gave design/eng/other depts a good shot. Time to focus on our people first.
- Low-stakes ≠ low-dedication. We overindexed on low dedication.
  - This is to say, we should do less of "you don't have to come on Friday" / "you can drop in whenever" and go back to having some sort of formal registration process. One thing that was cool from DEPLOY/23 was the idea of referrals/having a direct mechanism to tell your friends about it. Think also cool experiences e.g. 3D ticket customizer à la Next.js Conf et al.
- Echoing sentiments from DEPLOY/24, we should continue to emphasize staging as a social event to make friends/teams pre-hackathon

### Schedule

- In general, good job on schedule
- Reiterating: it's good for us to encourage coming to opening night
- Reiterating: *deadlines* per se might not be necessary, but *some* formal process for registration/team formation
- Workshops weren't that important; we hardly advertised them. We should expect Saturday to be as quiet as it has been for all of our weekend events so far. One idea is to go all in on the social/lunch/jam with other teams idea rather than mix it with workshops.

### Ground team / logistics

- We gotta figure out the whole leadership half-participating, half-organizing thing
  - We need *a* host (rather than multiple people "MCing"). The host is de-facto running the event. Schedule, weekend-of decisions, etc. go through them.
    - All leadership should still *know* what's going on, when, and how. We *cannot* have "oh ask (the host)" be a response to a question someone asks leadership about the hackathon.
  - This time we didn't do check-in, next time we'll need to; we need leadership free to help set up and run those things. Otherwise, it *should* be fine for leadership to participate in the hackathon, except for the host.
- Unhappy about no video. *We want video!*

### No need

- To do a livestream (idea from DEPLOY/24)
- To spend an absurd amount of money on the web platform

### Next steps

- Edward: document all of our learnings in framework
- Need a formal process in place for spending money (discuss, add to framework)
