What an insane semester for us. Let's recap, celebrate the wins, and look towards areas of improvement.

## The good

- In general, incredibly successful semester
- Word of mouth really strong
- Hackathon huge W
- Profs and students talking about us in classes >>>
- Starting events early in the semester (literally week one) was a really good call
- Going to freshman orientation was INSANE, easily most impactful student event to attend as a club
- Hive is a gamechanger, cozy and good vibes

## Room for improvement

- Photos turnaround time
  - Likewise with socials *(should we have someone helping Gursh with that?)*
- Workflow re: hosting and promoting events needs to be streamlined
- In general everything needs to be documented: Edward's Winter break project
- Should be openly friendlier to new members
  - Remember that leadership are hypepeople
- Being harder on leadership re: accountability
- More leadership people!

### Goalposts

- Multiple members of leadership could be absent from any given compsigh night and it is still able to be a success
- We are able to sustainably run events (with respect to finances)
