## Notes

- Walk-ins to non CS-classes an overall success
- Would be a good idea for next time to cater announcements and promos *to the department/program* we're promoting to; e.g. emphasize what a hackathon is for designers more than data scientists
- BLOOM platform almost good to go, only polish changes to the game and content changes CS department wants us to make
- Order with Toast & Egg placed
- Night one dinner narrowed down to pizza, Saigon Sandwich, and/or Aria
- Jet will grind out a trophy by Sunday
- Edward will send merch designs to print shop over the weekend
- We're kinda fucked for judges; Edward will reach out to Vercel friends
- Last week's compsigh night went alright
- We're good on staging
- Sponsorships: Warp hasn't gotten back; Vercel can't do food/regular sponsorship, but is down to support events
- No department fund update; that's probably on hold until after the hackathon
- Good on framework
- Good on GitHub Issues, just need to add to/use it more
