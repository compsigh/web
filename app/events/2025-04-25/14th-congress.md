## Agenda

Status updates:

- Gursh: [photos from staging 2/21, git workshop 3/28](https://github.com/compsigh/compsigh/issues/39)
- Kiana: [BLOOM hoodies](https://github.com/compsigh/compsigh/issues/44)
- Edward & Jet: Club Coalition updates

Review:

- Final checks & prep for cascade

## Notes

- Gursh promises to get photos done by EOD 4/26, when he goes home and has his PC to edit
- BLOOM hoodies status unclear â€” Kiana's contact not responding after two days
- Nothing of note from Club Coalition
- cascade good to go; Jet making final riddle touches, Kiana and Nish on setup, Edward on food
