## Agenda

- Revisiting gaps: phone numbers, email addresses, schedules
  - Calendar updates? (Jet, Nish)
- Todos update
- Spring Involvement Fair debrief
- First compsigh night debrief
- Walking into the classrooms week one debrief

## Notes

- Moving to [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/compsigh/projects/3) for tracking todos
  - General todos filed in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/compsigh/compsigh/issues)
- Spring Involvement Fair
  - Our best one yet
  - Room for improvement: we really ought to be salespeople out there — if we see people in front, mingling, reading the posters, etc. *walk up to them*
  - Nobody should be sitting *behind* the desk
  - Demos should be more interactive or not there; doesn't help to just have a menu screen on a laptop so far back no one can interact with it anyway
  - Cut back on music, hard to talk to people
  - More compsigh-themed decorations, but less dense on the table
    - e.g. pixel sign there was great, but with the books *and* the posters *and* everything else, felt a bit crowded
    - Cutesy collectibles type shit
  - Know where the other CS clubs / friends of compsigh are and be able to point to their table
- Walking into the classrooms update / vibe check / things to keep in mind for as we continue next week
  - More emphasis on following the Instagram
  - Less scripted is better
  - Personal story for whoever is talking
    - "You don't have to go through CS alone" type shit
- More collabs with other clubs
  - ACV × compsigh in progress
- Socials revamp
  - See [thread on Instagram ideas on GitHub Issues](https://github.com/compsigh/compsigh/issues/12)
  - Unfollow personal accounts, follow more clubs
- More regular activities at compsigh nights
  - Nish is on it
  - Technically speaking → "circles" e.g. latest tech/CS news

## Next meeting outline

- BLOOM pulse check
