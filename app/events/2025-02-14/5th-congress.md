## Notes

- BLOOM promo efforts going well; for this next week we should focus our efforts on walk-ins to non-CS classes, and doing email blasts. Good web platform a prereq, but we def can't wait for it. Come Tuesday (when we're back from holiday), shit gets sent out.
- We scheduled all 11 sections we want to appear in, now to send out emails to profs
- Kiana added stuff to include in the email template for promoting BLOOM to other CAS departments; Edward will modify and reach out to program directors
- Jet and Edward will schedule time to jam on the BLOOM trophy
- Edward and Nish will schedule time to jam on staging
- Edward will reach out to Toast & Egg for BLOOM day three catering
- Pineapple King good for BLOOM day two catering like DEPLOY/24
- Still need to solidify BLOOM day one dinner catering
- Workshop shit
  - Speaker should have slides done a week before
  - Speaker comes to Congress a week before and day of
  - Get them on the calendar / reach out 3 weeks before
- No department fund update this week
- Re: GitHub Issues, new labels are good. We could use separation btwn recurring tasks / low priority, and urgent stuff e.g. "edit photos and post"

## Todos

*(Expect these in GitHub Issues)*

- Add to framework: workshop protocol (Nish)
- BLOOM trophy/prizes situation
- BLOOM food situation

All the "schedule time" ones will be taken care of over Discord

Nothing else new, just keep a pulse on the existing ones especially for BLOOM
