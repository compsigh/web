## Notes

- ❗ Kiana: finding a cheaper place for BLOOM hoodies
- Cascade
  - Jet finished 2 riddles
  - ❗ Leadership should test ([github](https://github.com/compsigh/cascaders))
- Framework
  - Finance docs done (cleared by Jocelyn and John from E&I)
  - ❗ Edward will finish whatever else by next week
- Destination USF
  - ❗ Edward: design and print flyers
- Next compsigh night (4/11)
  - Technically Speaking & Demos
- DEPLOY/25
  - We should start planning now
  - Non-CS people didn't work out for BLOOM, not worth the time
  - We want to allow AI, but should try to prevent "bad AI uses", like just a basic wrapper
    - We can show examples of "good AI projects" and "bad AI projects"
    - Judges deduct points for bad uses of AI
    - We should do industry judges again (BLOOM judging was great)
  - Keep BLOOM-style art, but don't spend $850 again
