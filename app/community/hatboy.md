## i really like PICO-8

PICO-8 is a game engine that emulates the limits of 8-bit gaming systems:

- there's only 16 (ish) colors
- you get roughly 8k tokens to program the entire game with
- there are only three variable types: strings, 32-bit floats, and hashmaps

you do everything inside the editor: code, paint sprites, compose music.

i knew i wanted to draw all the art & do everything myself. using PICO-8 leads to a certain style all games made with it share, and i love it. because there's limited *(everything)*, i know i'm not gonna be able to get *exactly* what i want, which is ok. you're more creative inside a box. or something like that.

What is Hatboy?

> Hatboy is about a hungry rabbit and a hat. He wants to eat before the mouths eat his food. You can only eat when you're outside the hat. You can recall your hat.

What are your favorite games?

> My #1 favorite game is Celeste, which *started* as a PICO8 game during a game jam. I'm also a fan of PUNKCAKE Délicieux, this cute studio that makes a game every month, and they also start as a PICO8. I want to be able to prototype things quickly, and I think PICO8 is great for that.

Why Hatboy?

> I wanted to learn this cute little game engine, PICO8, and get a full game loop in the three days that we had.

What language is that?

> It's a variation of Lua.

What kinds of challenges come with using that?

> So there's only three variable types: strings, 32-bit floats, and hash tables. So, if you want an array, you've gotta make a hash table where key `0` is the first index of (meow)

What can u takeaway from this proj

I'm generalyl the tyype of person to try to perfect one thing at a time, so I like the approach of make the main character, get all their animations right, make the controls feel good, THEN add more stuff. i wasnt able to test the full gameplay loop until like the last ten minutes, so if i could redo it, i'd make it playable earlier on. one thing that i added at the end that helped was a timer, because now it's like "what's the highest score you can get in 60 seconds" as opposed to "oh, i got 100, and eventually i'll have -100"
