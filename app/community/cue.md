Cue is a minimalist active recall study app focused on helping students ask the right questions. Transform your notes into actionable study cards for easy pasting back into Google Docs or Notion, or export to Anki.

## Inspiration

Cue was born at Dons Hack 2023, the annual Spring hackathon hosted by our friends at ACM × WiT.

The timing for an AI-powered study app was just right:

- That semester, we were both taking note-heavy courses
- It was March–April 2023, and [OpenAI had just announced GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4)
- The theme for the hackathon was ed-tech: build a solution that solves a problem in education

So, what's the problem we're solving? There are plenty of flashcard apps out there. The thing is, they assume you already know what to study. We thought to leverage what we know about active recall — one of the most efficient, science-backed study methods — to create a tool that **helps students ask the right questions**.

## Hackathon

We had a collective three months' worth of web dev experience, and had to learn a lot, fast. That's one of the great things about hackathons — win or lose, you'll likely walk away knowing a hell of a lot more than you did coming in.

We built Cue using:

- [React](https://react.dev) & [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres)
- OpenAI API
- [Vercel KV](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv)
- [NextAuth](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)

Around this time, I was also getting into UI design, and I wanted to push myself to have Cue stand out from the crowd.

The vibes were great:

Oh, and we won, too. :)

## Features

So, what does Cue actually do?

Its primary function is to take your study notes, and return the most relevant questions to quiz yourself on.

We're happy to say we continued working on Cue after Dons Hack, and shipped some pretty cool features.

### Invite system

<Media

  description={<>From day one, we made the app open to all USF students for free, but we wanted an invite system for our friends &amp; family elsewhere. Here we hooked up Typeform to an API that would generate an invite code like <code>gaius-julius-caesar</code>.</>}

<Grid columns={2} columnSizeDistribution={["1fr", "3fr"]}>
  <Media
    src="/community/cue/invite-cards.mp4"
    style={{
      marginTop: 'unset'
    }}
  />
  <div>
    <p>We really liked the idea of invites, and we went all out, because why not?</p>
    <p>We produced a set of 50 <em>physical</em> invite cards, each with their own unique invite linked via QR code.</p>
    <p>Invites had conditions like <code>no-invite</code> (invited students can&apos;t also +1) to help us scale reasonably.</p>
    <p>We also gave these out at Destination USF.</p>
  </div>
</Grid>

### Waitlist

Edward [posted about Cue on X](https://x.com/edwardshturman/status/1662181707955486722) and we got a decent amount of students signing up for the beta. In August 2023, we sent out the invites.

Since then, we've put development on pause as we push through a heavy junior year in computer science. We hope to return shortly thereafter!
