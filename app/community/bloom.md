We just wrapped up BLOOM, our first ever Spring hackathon! This one means a lot. BLOOM was an experiment — in emphasizing collaboration across the arts & sciences, in encouraging more *human* projects, and in creating beginner-friendly spaces for hackers.

Here's how it went.

## How BLOOM is different

When we were brainstorming and looked over our notes from past events like DEPLOY/24, we wanted to do a few things differently. We felt our past events gave an outsized advantage, proportional to a project's technical complexity, which is not what we're going for as a club. We experimented with addressing this on a couple axes:

### :3 For beginners

Whether the vibes were intense, or we had strict registration deadlines, we'd received feedback that our previous events had a perceivable barrier to entry. We wanted to do away with those and make it clear beginners are not only welcome but encouraged.

We also did away with the rubric and grade-level weighting we had for DEPLOY/24. We put trust in judges to essentially run a vibe check and adjust their evaluations on their own.

### :o For people

We encouraged teams to make projects unrelated to generative AI. At first, we were worried this would turn people away, but the results were awesome.

### \<3 For everyone

**BLOOM is all about personal project exploration.** A low-stakes, high-quality playground for ideas. We wanted to open the space to projects from all walks of scientific & creative life.

From email campaigns, to posters, to presenting in 30+ class sections, we worked to emphasize that *anyone* from USF is welcome. After all, the most interesting projects are at the intersection of art & technology.
