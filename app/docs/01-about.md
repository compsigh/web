Today, many computer science students feel pressured to follow the script of getting a job in tech because it pays well, keeping their head down and grinding the technical interview, and end up dissolving their curiosity, problem-solving, and ideas about the world along the way.

*Regardless of the path you're walking, you don't have to do it alone.*

compsigh is for <CasePreserver>CS</CasePreserver> majors â€” and our friends from other walks of creative study â€” looking to take back the director's seat.

We are coming together to create a social and supportive community around learning new things, and building fun & awesome projects.

We don't need to concern ourselves with typical college club corporate nonsense. We take what we do *sincerely*, not too seriously.

We uphold a culture of documentation, learning & building in public, and feedback.

We are goal-agnostic: whether you're pursuing a job at <CasePreserver>FAANG</CasePreserver>, doing your own thing, or just looking to hang out with wholesome, like-minded people, you'll find a home here. ðŸ’› âœ¨
