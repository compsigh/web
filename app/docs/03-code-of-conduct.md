This Code of Conduct establishes expectations for online and offline interaction in club spaces. *(We assume a reasonable baseline of respect and civility.)* We don't take ourselves too seriously, but we are committed to maintaining a welcoming space to chill with friends after a long week of school. `vibes >>>`

## Offline spaces

- Respect the space: our gracious hosts â€” such as the Engineering Department for the Social Hive â€” welcome us into their homes, and we should treat them accordingly.

## Online spaces

compsigh is a pretty chill place â€” you can largely say and do whatever you want. We are pro-free speech, and as a club we think it's important to stoke thought-provoking discussion. But there's a time & place for everything. :)

### Content

- Keep discussions on politics & other contentious topics in threads.
- <CasePreserver>NSFW</CasePreserver> is ok, but it must be clearly labeled <CasePreserver>NSFW</CasePreserver> and sent behind a spoiler tag.
- Avoid posting content that violates [Discord's <CasePreserver>TOS</CasePreserver>](https://discord.com/terms) or their [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).

### Code & resource sharing

- Avoid sharing cracked, pirated, or otherwise illegal resources.
- Sharing code is ok, though we highly recommend following your professor's rules. If you get caught, it's not on us! :p
- You're welcome to self-promo *(we encourage it!)* but avoid sending messages (including unsolicited DMs) that are:
  - Spammy in nature; or
  - Irrelevant advertisements, particularly when you don't send anything else.
