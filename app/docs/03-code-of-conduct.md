Our goal is to foster an open, inclusive, and safe community. This Code of Conduct establishes expectations to uphold those standards for the club.

- ## No bigotry, hate speech, harassment, or shitty behavior

  compsigh is a safe space. Reports will be forwarded to the school, police, friends, and family.

- ## No NSFW

  We are a family-friendly club, for the people that are young in collage, for those who it makes uncomfortable, for the professors we have, for the kids of speakers, for the sponsors we have. Do it somewhere else.

- ## Respect the space

  We are grateful for the spaces we host events in. Please cleanup after yourself and leave the space better than how you found it.

- ## Don't break anyone else's rules

  We use discord and are a USF club. Adhere to their rules aswell:

  - Discord [Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and [TOS](https://discord.com/terms)

  - [USF Student Conduct](https://myusf.usfca.edu/fogcutter/student-conduct)

- ## Don't break the law

  It's simple. Don't break the law. Cracked, pirated, resources are not allowed here.

- ## Don't Advertize

  We are a open club, don't abuse your access to a group of wonderful people for your own benefit.
  We encourage all members to self-promo, but please do it in a way that is not spammy or annoying.

- ## Sharing code is ok

  Following your professor's rules around sharing, using, and collaborating on projects.

Our goal is beyond the shitty behaviour of a single person, we have no problem being without you.
