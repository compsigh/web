Our goal is to foster an open, inclusive, and safe community. This Code of Conduct establishes expectations to uphold those standards for the club.

## No bigotry, hate speech, harassment, or shitty behavior

  compsigh is a safe space. Reports will be forwarded to the school, police, friends, and family.

## No NSFW

  For the people that are young in college, for those who it makes uncomfortable, for the kids of speakers, for the sponsors we have. Do it somewhere else.

## Respect the space

  We are grateful for the spaces we host events in. Please clean up after yourself and leave the space better than you found it.

## Don't break anyone else's rules

  We use Discord and are a USF club. Adhere to their rules as well:

- Discord [Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and [TOS](https://discord.com/terms)

- [USF Student Conduct](https://myusf.usfca.edu/fogcutter/student-conduct)

## Don't break the law

  It's simple. Don't break the law. Cracked or pirated resources are not allowed here.

## Don't advertise

  We are an open club; don't abuse your access to a group of wonderful people for your own benefit.
  We encourage all members to self-promo, but please do it in a way that is not spammy or annoying.

## Sharing code is okay

  Follow your professor's rules on sharing, using, and collaborating on projects.

We will not tolerate shitty behavior from anyone. If you cannot respect these standards, you are not welcome here.

## Contact

If you have a report or questions, please contact `leadership@compsigh.club` or anyone from [leadership](/docs/leadership/about).
