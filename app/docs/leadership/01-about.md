Every day, members of the club contribute their time and ideas to making our community awesome. Several of our events — like **clone** workshops & **demos** — are organized by these passionate and generous people. Some even make food for events! <span style={{ color: 'var(--color-light-50)' }}>Shoutout Tao \<3</span>

However, as the club grows, we need a stable, core group of members committed and responsible for the club's success. This is the leadership team.

We don't use phrases like "eboard" because we don't prioritize seniority or experience — we've had members join a month into their first semester at <CasePreserver>USF</CasePreserver>. *Genuine passion and motivation to learn & to help the club thrive are more valuable than either of these.*

We don't run applications, but we are regularly looking to invite club members to the team. If you're involved, if you take an active interest in helping others, and if you're looking to push yourself in learning new skills, you'd be a great addition. :)

In the spirit of documenting the compsigh culture, whether you're thinking about where you could help, or just curious about how we do things, read on: 💛 ✨
