## Philosophy of leadership

Every day, members of the club contribute their time and ideas to making our community awesome. Several of our events are organized by these passionate and generous people.

However, as the club grows, we need a stable, core group of members who are committed and responsible for the club's success. This is the leadership team.

We don't use phrases like "eboard" because we don't prioritize seniority or experience â€” we've had members join a month into their first semester at USF.

*Genuine passion and motivation to learn & to help the club thrive are more valuable than either of these.*
