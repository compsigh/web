# Leadership

We don't run applications, but we're regularly looking to invite club members. If you're involved, if you take an active interest in helping others, and if you're looking to push yourself in learning new skills, you'd be a great addition.

We'll reach out to you. If you really think you'd be a good fit, we'll hear you out. Nothing is better than a self-motivated person.

# Term Limits

Members join the team on a rolling basis, and have no term limits.
