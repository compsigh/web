**compsigh is an entirely student-bootstrapped club.** We don't receive funding from USF. We also don't charge members anything. Everything we do, we do together, and for free.

Our [expense tracker](https://compsigh.notion.site/expense-tracker-7e1fc8c3a507491e9439cce0d13cb1bc) is open-source.

Common costs the club incurs:

- Food for compsigh nights
- Marketing materials (e.g. stickers, fonts, etc.)
- Supporting leadership operations and club member projects (e.g. Meta Verified, Midjourney, etc.)

By donating to compsigh, you're supporting everything from hosting events, to shipping club member projects, to maintaining the club's creative freedom.

You can [support us through Stripe](https://donate.stripe.com/eVa7uv8EkcRcgH6fZ0).

Thanks so much for your consideration! ðŸ’› âœ¨
