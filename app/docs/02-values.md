## People first

There's a reason `meet cool people` is first in our tagline: we believe getting together is a precursor to `building cool things`, as well as its own reward.

## Keep it casual

We don't need to concern ourselves with typical college club corporate nonsense. We take what we do *sincerely*, not too seriously.

## Open source

We uphold a culture of documentation, learning & building in public, and feedback.
